Description: Command line personal finances manager
 Keeping track of personal finances is an incredibly boring task, and if
 you don't have much money then juggling it can be tricky. When looking at
 the existing software out there to manage accounts it's frequently highly
 complex and top heavy. Fin - an abbreviation of "financials" - is an
 attempt to do the opposite of what most accounting software does, and
 that's to make things incredibly simple and quick. Logging a transaction
 or viewing your current balance should take no more than a few sec
