%description
Keeping track of personal finances is an incredibly boring task, and if you
don't have much money then juggling it can be tricky. When looking at the
existing software out there to manage accounts it's frequently highly
complex and top heavy. Fin - an abbreviation of "financials" - is an
attempt to do the opposite of what most accounting software does, and
that's to make things incredibly simple and quick. Logging a transaction or
viewing your current balance should take no more than a few sec
